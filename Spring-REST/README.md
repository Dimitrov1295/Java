This demo shows how to create simple RESTful services using Spring MVC.

See it hosted here: http://www.ivandimitrov.co.uk/SpringREST/query

Data is taken from the Rfam READONLY database jdbc:mysql://mysql-rfam-public.ebi.ac.uk:4497/Rfam

From the Rfam website https://rfam.xfam.org/:

"The Rfam database is a collection of RNA families, each represented by multiple sequence alignments, consensus secondary structures and covariance models (CMs)."

I have no clue what the above means, but it's data for sure.

After successfully executing this program, you can see the result at http://localhost:8080/query by default.
